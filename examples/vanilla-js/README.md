# BlueJeans Web Client SDK - Vanilla JS example

This example app is intended to showcase basic features of the web-client-sdk

## Installation

You need to host `index.html` on a server to load the example application.

There are multiple ways to instantiate a localhost server. You can refer this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for more info.

One way of instantiating is utilizing npm's  `http-server` module

```shell
  npx http-server -p 3000
 ```
